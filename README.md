This website is created with three main functionalities:
- Login a user
- Register a user
- Display list of users applying pagination, sorting and filtering
- Updating and deleting a user

A user can login to the website by entering their username and a valid email. If a user does not have an account, they can click the 'Create Account' link below the login form. This will redirect the user to the register page. Here the user has to enter the following details in order to register successfully into the website:
- username
- email
- country
- state
- city 

Once registered, the user is then sent back to the login screen to login using the username and password that they just registered.

Upon successful login, the user will be directed to a users screen that will display a list of users. A user can delete another user by clicking the 'Delete' button. If the user deletes their own information from the table, then after logging out, that user cannot sign back in. 

A user can also update a user. Upon clicking the 'Update' button, a form pops up displaying the information of the user that is being updated. Once the 'Submit' button is clicked on the form, the user gets updated.
